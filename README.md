Sansan Messaging Grid is chatbot written in NodeJS, using the Slack API to post Android: Netrunner cards and decklists into Slack channels in response to user requests.

Instructions on using this bot in your own Slack channel are coming soon.

Usage instructions and examples can be found at [anrnz.com](http://www.anrnz.com/p/slack.html) until full project documentation is published on Github Pages.

In the meantime, partial API documentation can be viewed at frogamic.github.io/sansan-messaging-grid/api/
